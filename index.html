  <h3 id="whatisqr">What is QR?</h3>
  <div> 
    <p>A QR code (Quick Response code) is a type of two-dimensional barcode that stores 
    information in a machine-readable format. Originally created in Japan for tracking
    automotive parts, QR codes have become widely used for linking to websites, apps,
    and digital content. </p>
    <p>Unlike traditional barcodes, QR codes can hold much more data and can be scanned 
    from any angle using smartphones or QR code readers. When scanned, a QR code can 
    instantly open a URL, show contact details, display text, or trigger app actions 
    - making it a fast and convenient way to connect the physical world with the 
    digital one. </p>
    <p>Today, QR codes are everywhere - on business cards, menus, posters, product 
    packaging, and even in advertising. They provide a seamless way for users to access
    information or take action with just a single scan.</p>

  <h3 id="faq">FAQ</h3>
  <div>
    <h4>Q: What is a QR code used for?</h4>
    <p>A: QR codes are used to quickly share information like website links, contact 
    details, Wi-Fi passwords, or app downloads. They're commonly found on flyers, 
    packaging, menus, business cards, and more.</p>

    <h4>Q: Is it free to generate QR codes on this site?</h4>
    <p>A: Yes! This tool is completely free to use — generate as many QR codes as you 
    need.</p>

    <h4>Q: Do the QR codes created here expire?</h4>
    <p>A: No. The QR codes you generate here are static, meaning they do not expire and
