  <h3 id="whatisqr">What is QR?</h3>
    <p>A QR code (Quick Response code) is a type of two-dimensional barcode that stores 
    information in a machine-readable format. Originally created in Japan for tracking
    automotive parts, QR codes have become widely used for linking to websites, apps,
    and digital content. </p>
    <p>Unlike traditional barcodes, QR codes can hold much more data and can be scanned 
    from any angle using smartphones or QR code readers. When scanned, a QR code can 
    instantly open a URL, show contact details, display text, or trigger app actions 
    - making it a fast and convenient way to connect the physical world with the 
    digital one. </p>
    <p>Today, QR codes are everywhere - on business cards, menus, posters, product 
    packaging, and even in advertising. They provide a seamless way for users to access
    information or take action with just a single scan.</p>
